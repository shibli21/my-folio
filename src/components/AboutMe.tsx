              I'm a computer nerd and a computer science student major. I'm really passionate about coding, software
              development, and web design.I have been working with react.js, javascript, and typescript for couple of
              years now. I have experience coding in node.
              <br />I have built a few complex apps in react and javascript so I am confident in my abilities to deliver
              great work.
              <br />
              <br />
              In addition to that i have been developing apps using Flutter for over a year now. With this experience I
              have created products that can be used to develop cross-platform mobile apps in less time. I love to learn
              new things and I'm always looking for new ways to do things.
